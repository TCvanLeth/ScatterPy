Python module to calculate scattering amplitude and phase matrices of
rotationally symmetric particles based on the T-matrix method.

Based on the original Fortran T-matrix code by Mishchenko.
Currently spheroids, Chebyshev shapes and generalized chebyshev shapes are
implemented. Also includes several empirical raindrop shapes.

Download and install with pip:
